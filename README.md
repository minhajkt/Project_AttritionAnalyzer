# Project_AttritionAnalyzer
## Project Overview 
Verizonet, a telecommunications company based in California, has been operating for six years, providing phone and internet services to customers across more than a thousand cities. Eventhough they have a highly skilled sales team and there are successfully attracting new clients, the company faces a significant loss of their present customers.
This is a project that mainly look into the reasos that made the customers think to dicsontinue their present service providers services and go for other service providers.
We will look into the those reasons and suggest the company some possible ways they could take to reduce their present problem of attrition.
We will help them with the ideas to attract new clients whcich could help their sales team work more effficiently and effectively.

## Steps
1. Import the required libraries initially. Some other libraries will be imported accordingly
2. Import the dataset on which we need to work on
3. Exploring the data
4. Data Cleaning
5. Visualizing some categorical data like City-Customer, Internet service, Online Security, Streaming, Contract, Data, Gender, Age etc.
6. Age is converted to age groups
7. Label Encoding
8. Splitting the dataset to Dependent and Independent feaures. We have around 41 dependent features
9. Feature Selection based on correlation
10. Removing dependent features that are highly correlated
11. Feature_imortances_ is used to find most ranked features which can be used for model training. A total of 10 features are selected
12. assigning this new features as our dependent features
13. Splitting the dataset to Train and Test data
14. Training the dataset in various algorithms:
    ### Logistic Regression
    ### Decision Tree Classifier
    ### Random Forest Calssifier
    ### Gradient Boosting
    ### XGBoosting
    ### Support Vector Classifier
    ### K Nearest Neighbors
15. Visualzation of the Dependent Varaibles with respect to the Target Variable
16. Observations based on the visaulization is noted
17. Possible ways to deal with the attrition is suggested based on the data visaulization
18. Conclusion on the ways to reduce the attrition rate is suggested along with ideas to attract new customers.
